# Piping or Chaining Data

--- .class #id

## Piping or Chaining

- We will discuss a concept that will help us greatly when it comes to working with our data. 
- The usual way to perform multiple operations in one line is by nesting. 

--- .class #id

## Piping or Chaining

To consider an example we will look at the data provided in the gapminder package:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

--- .class #id

## Nesting vs Chaining

- Let's say that we want to have the GDP per capita and life expectancy Kenya.
- Traditionally speaking we could do this in a nested manner:


```{r, eval=F}
filter(select(gapminder, country, lifeExp, gdpPercap), country=="Kenya")
```

--- .class #id

## Nesting vs Chaining

- It is not easy to see exactly what this code was doing but we can write this in a manner that follows our logic much better. 
- The code below represents how to do this with chaining. 

```{r, eval=F}
gapminder %>%
    select(country, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
    filter(country=="Kenya")
```

--- .class #id

## Breaking Down the Code

- We now have something that is much clearer to read.
- Here is what our chaining command says:
    1. Take the `gapminder` data
    2. Select the variables: `country`, `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`.
    3. Only keep information from Kenya. 
- The nested code says the same thing but it is hard to see what is going on if you have not been coding for very long.


--- .class #id

## Breaking Down the Code

- The result of this search is below: 


```
# A tibble: 12 x 3
   country lifeExp gdpPercap
    <fctr>   <dbl>     <dbl>
 1   Kenya  42.270  853.5409
 2   Kenya  44.686  944.4383
 3   Kenya  47.949  896.9664
 4   Kenya  50.654 1056.7365
 5   Kenya  53.559 1222.3600
 6   Kenya  56.155 1267.6132
 7   Kenya  58.766 1348.2258
 8   Kenya  59.339 1361.9369
 9   Kenya  59.285 1341.9217
10   Kenya  54.407 1360.4850
11   Kenya  50.992 1287.5147
12   Kenya  54.110 1463.2493
```

--- .class #id

## What is `%>%`

- In the previous code we saw that we used `%>%` in the command you can think of this as saying ***then***.
- For example:

```{r, eval=F}
gapminder %>%
    select(country, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
    filter(country=="Kenya")
```

--- .class #id

## What Does this Mean?

- This translates to:
    - Take Gapminder ***then*** select these columns select(country, lifeExp, gdpPercap) ***then*** filter out so we only keep Kenya


--- .class #id

## Why Chain?

- We still might ask why we would want to do this. 
- Chaining increases readability significantly when there are many commands. 
- With many packages we can replace the need to perform nested arguments. 
- The chaining operator is automatically imported from the [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) package. 

--- .class #id

## User Defined Function


- Let's say that we wish to find the Euclidean distance between two vectors say, `x1` and `x2`. 
- We could use the math formula:

\[\sqrt{\sum(x_1-x_2)^2}\]

--- .class #id

## User Defined Function

- In the nested manner this would be:

```{r results='hide'}
x1 <- 1:5; x2 <- 2:6
sqrt(sum((x1-x2)^2))
```

--- .class #id

## User Defined Function


- However, if we chain this we can see how we would perform this mathematically. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# chaining method
(x1-x2)^2 %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
```
- If we did it by hand we would perform elementwise subtraction of `x2` from `x1` ***then*** we would sum those elementwise values ***then*** we would take the square root of the sum. 


--- .class #id

## User Defined Function


```{r}
# chaining method
(x1-x2)^2 %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
```

- Many of us have been performing calculations by this type of method for years, so that chaining really is more natural for us.

# The `spread()` Function

--- .class #id


## The `spread()` Function

- The first `tidyr` function we will look into is the `spread()` function. 
- With `spread()` it does similar to what you would expect.  
- We have a data frame where some of the rows contain information that is really a variable name. 
- This means the columns are a combination of variable names as well as some data. 

--- .class #id


## What does it do?

The picture below displays this:



<center>
<img src="./assets/img/tidy-spread.png" style="height:100%;width:80%">
</center>


--- .class #id

## Consider this Data:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
table2
```

--- .class #id

## `key` column

- Notice that in the column of `key`, instead of there being values we see the following variable names:
    - cases
    - population

--- .class #id

## What Should we see?

- In order to use this data we need to have it so the data frame looks like this instead:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
spread(table2, key, value)
```

--- .class #id

## Using the `spread()` Function

- Now we can see that we have all the columns representing the variables we are interested in and each of the rows is now a complete observation. 
- In order to do this we need to learn about the `spread()` function:

--- .class #id

## The `spread()` Function

```
spread(data, key, value)
```

- Where
    - `data` is your dataframe of interest. 
    - `key` is the column whose values will become variable names. 
    - `value` is the column where values will fill in under the new variables created from `key`. 

--- .class #id

## Piping

- If we consider **piping**, we can write this as:

```
data %>%
  spread(key, value)
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example


- Now if we consider table2 , we can see that we have:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
table2
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

- Now this table was made for this example so key is the `key` in our `spread()` function and value is the `value` in our `spread()` function.
- We can fix this with the following code:

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

```{R}
table2 %>%
    spread(key,value)
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

- We can now see that we have a variable named `cases` and a variable named `population`. 
- This is much more tidy. 







--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice 

- In this example we will use the dataset `population` that is part of tidyverse. 
- Print this data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(population,1)
```

--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice 

- You should see the table that we have above, now We have a variable named `year`, assume that we wish to actually have each year as its own variable. 
- Using the `spread()` function, redo this data so that each year is a variable. 
- Your data will look like this at the end:


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice

```{r, echo=FALSE}
population %>% spread(year, population)
```

# The `gather()` Function


--- .class #id


## The `gather()` Function

- The second `tidyr` function we will look into is the `gather()` function. 
- With `gather()` it may not be clear what exactly is going on, but in this case we actually have a lot of column names the represent what we would like to have as data values. 

--- .class #id



<center>
<img src="./assets/img/tidy-gather.png" style="height:100%;width:80%">
</center>


--- .class #id


## The `gather()` Function Example


- For example, in the last `spread()` practice you created a data frame where variable names were individual years. 
- This may not be what you want to have so you can use the gather function. 


--- .class #id


## Consider `table4`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table4

```

--- .class #id

## Table 4

- This looks similar to the table you created in the `spread()` practice.
- We now wish to change this data frame so that `year` is a variable and 1999 and 2000 become values instead of variables. 

--- .class #id


## In Comes the `gather()` Function

- We will accomplish this with the gather function:

```
gather(data, key, value, ...)
```
- where
    - `data` is the data frame you are working with. 
    - `key` is the name of the `key` column to create.
    - `value` is the name of the `value` column to create.
    - `...` is a way to specify what columns to gather from. 

--- .class #id


## `gather()` Example

- In our example here we would do the following:

```{R}
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", 2:3)
```

--- .class #id

## `gather()` Example

- You can see that we have created 2 new columns called `year` and `cases`. 
- We filled these with the previous 2nd and 3rd columns. 
- Note that we could have done this in many different ways too. 


--- .class #id

## `gather()` Example

- For example if we knew the years but not which columns we could do this:

```
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", "1999":"2000")
```

- We could also see that we want to gather all columns except the first so we could have used:

```
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", -1)
```


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice

- Create `population2` from last example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
population 2 <- population %>% 
                    spread(year, population)
```

- Now gather the columns that are labeled by year and create columns `year` and `population`. 


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice


In the end your data frame should look like:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(population,2)
```
