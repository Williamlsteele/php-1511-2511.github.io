## Part 1: Both PHP 1511 and 2511 

We will be considering the Titanic Dataset. The variables in this dataset are:

--------------------------------------------------------
variable    Description
----------- ------------------------------------------------
survival	  Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes

pclass	    Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd

sex	        Sex

Age	        Age in years	

sibsp	      # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic

parch	      # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	

ticket	    Ticket number	

fare	      Passenger fare	

cabin	      Cabin number	

embarked	  Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can read this data in with the following code:

```{r}
load("titanic.RData")
```


Your goal will be to consider a logistic regression to model Survival. The thought behind survival was that it was about women and children first. Your goal will be to model this relationship and to understand what else might have played a role in survival. 

1. Display through tables or plots:
    a. Survival by age
    b. Survival by sex
    c. Survival by embarked
    d. Survival by pclass
    Then comment on what you notice about these relationships. 

2. Build a logistic regression model with main effects only. Start with a table of univariate models and display a final multiple variable model. Include:
    - A few sentences on what you notice in simple regressions.
    - A sentence or two about why you chose your multiple model.
    - Does your model suggest that survival was about women and children? 


3. Is this model well calibrate? Explain and display results or a figure to back your explanations. 

4. Does this model discriminate well? Explain and display results or a figure to back your explanations. 
    

## Part 2: 2511 Only


5. Build a Logistic regression model exploring the interaction between sex and class by including the interaction into your multiple regression model above. Include:
    - a sentence or two on how this changes your above results.
    - a sentence or two on what this tells you about sex and class. 
    - interpret the survival for females and then interpret the survival for males. 
    
6. How is the calibration and discrimination of this model?
